Lab 3: Perl
</H2>
<HR>
<P>
Begin by using your favorite text editor 
to edit the file <TT>year_codes.pl</TT>.
Take a moment to study it, to see how it implements our basic
algorithm, and compare it to the other "programs" you've seen.
</P>

<p>Lets begin by defining a Perl function with a BNF:</p>

<!-- BEGIN BNF Block -->
<pre>
SubroutineDef   ::=   <b>sub identifier</b> SubroutineBody
SubroutineBody  ::=   <b>{</b> ParamOptions StatementList <b>}</b>
</pre>

<p>
If you haven't noticed this BNF simply declares the subroutine without any 
indication of parameters or return type. Perl subroutines receive any parameters
that are passed while being called and adds those parameters to an array named @_ 
(@ is the symbol used when declaring an array in perl). The user is given the task
of retrieving those parameters from that array. Study the BNF below to understand 
the different ways of retrieving your parameters.

<pre>
ParamOptions    ::=   ShiftStatements | ListAssignment | DirectAccess | &#8709;

ShiftStatements ::=   ShiftStatement ShiftStatements | &#8709;
ShiftStatement  ::=   <b>my $identifier = shift;</b>

ListAssignment  ::=   <b>my (</b> ParameterDecs <b>) = @_;</b>
ParameterDecs   ::=   <b>$identifier</b> MoreParams | &#8709;
MoreParams      ::=   , <b>$identifier</b> MoreParams | &#8709;

DirectAccess    ::=   <b>my $identifier = $_[</b> Index <b>];</b>
DirectAccesses  ::=   DirectAccess DirectAccesses | &#8709;
</pre>

<p>
The first of the three options, the shift statement, essentially pops the first item in the parameter array off the array and into a variable the same way a stack would. The second options, the list assignment, is the equivalent to the way most other languages access their parameters and will likely be the method you will use most often. The third option, the direct access, allows the programmer to access specific items in the list in whatever order they like, which is useful in a few select cases but we will not be exploring those situations now. Because we only have one parameter lets use the first of the three parameter options (the shift statement), write a method stub called
<tt>year_code</tt> with a parameter called <tt>year</tt>.</p>
You can test your stub from the command-line by entering:
<pre>
   perl year_codes.pl 
</pre>
If your stub is syntactically correct, it should run and
produce behavior something like this:
<pre>
   Enter the academic year: <u>freshman</u>
   The equivelant numeric code is: nil
</pre>
Make sure your stub is syntactically correct before you continue.

<h3>Basics of Selection</h3>
<p>Now that you've got a method stub written, let's add the
selection statement that 
should run our algorithm. As you probably expected, selection in
Perl takes the form of an
 <tt>if</tt> statement. The BNF for a Perl <tt>if</tt> statement is
as follows:</p>

<!-- BEGIN BNF Block -->
<pre>
IfStmt    ::= <b>if (</b> Expression <b>) {</b> StatementList <b>}</b> ElsifPart ElsePart
ElsifPart ::= <b>elsif (</b> Expression <b>) {</b> StatementList <b>}</b> ElsifPart ElsePart | &#8709;
ElsePart  ::= <b>else {</b> StatementList <b>}</b> | &#8709;
</pre>
<!-- END BNF Block -->

<p>One important thing to note about Perl <tt>if</tt> statements is
that the 
expression they evaluate is pretty wide open. Similar to the C
family of languages, 
Perl can evaluate things other than boolean expressions. In Perl,
everything is true 
except for <tt>false</tt> and <tt>undef</tt>. What this means is that
any object you
throw in there will evaluate to true. Furthermore Perl has an
interesting syntactical 
twist on the <tt>if</tt> statement called the <tt>unless</tt>
statement. 
<tt>unless</tt> will execute its StatementList <em>unless</em> its
Expression is true. 
The BNF for <tt>unless</tt> looks like this:</p>

<!-- BEGIN BNF Block -->
<pre>
UnlessStmt ::= <b>unless (</b> Expression <b>) {</b> StatementList <b>}</b> ElsePart
ElsePart  ::= <b>else {</b> StatementList <b>}</b> | &#8709;
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> There is <em>no</em> <tt>elsif</tt> in an
<tt>unless</tt> statement. 

<!-- END BNF Block -->

<p>Another cool feature of selection statements that Perl has
is the ability to tack them onto the end of an expression. 
So you could say something like: <tt>user.destroy if
user.invalid?</tt></p>

<h2>String Comparisons with Regular Expressions</h2>
<p>One last feature of Perl we'll need to cover in order to
implement our algorithm is how to do string comparison.
Perl provides a variety of ways, including:
<ul>
 <li>
  <tt>s1 == s2</tt>, which returns true if and only if
   <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt> have the same values (ASCII).
 <li>
  <tt>s1.equal? s2</tt>, which returns true if and only if
   <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt> refer to the same object
   (essentially a pointer comparison).
 <li>
  <tt>s1.eq? s2</tt>, which returns true if and only if
   <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt> have the same hash values.
 <li>
   <tt>s1.eq s2</tt>, which returns true if the string values are the same and is the standard comparison for strings
</ul>
</p><p>
We could solve this problem using the standard <tt>eq</tt> operator.
(If you want, feel free to try this out before continuing.)
</p><p>

However, let's explore a different to solve the problem.
Perl has a fully functional built-in 
regular expression parser. Regular expressions in Perl syntax: 
a valid expression, surrounded by / characters. <tt>/</tt> characters.
In order to compare a string in Perl to a regular expression,
we use the <b><tt>=~</tt></b> operator.
Put together, this 
results in the following statement to determine if the input year
matches &quot;freshman&quot;:
<pre>
   if ($year =~ /freshman/)
</pre>
</p> <p>
Be sure to test your program on both valid and invalid input values.
</p> <p>
What happens if you enter <tt><u>supersenior</u></tt> as a test-value?
Is this a feature or a bug?
<p>
When you are confident that your program is working properly,
use <tt>script</tt> to create a recording in which you
<ol>
 <li>
  Use <tt>cat</tt> to list your program.
 <li>
  Use <tt>perl</tt> to run and test your program,
   showing that it works correctly for both valid and invalid 
   input values.
</ol>
Then print a hard copy of your script file.
<p>
That concludes the Perl part of this lab.
