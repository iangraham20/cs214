Lab 4: Perl

<P>
Begin by using your favorite text editor
to edit the file <TT>log_table.pl</TT>.
Take a moment to study it, to see how it implements our basic
algorithm,
and compare it to the other "programs" you've seen.
</P>

<p>Today we'll be looking at repetition. Perl provides a
<tt>for</tt> loop for solving counting problems, 
along with a <tt>while</tt> and <tt>until</tt> loop.
The <tt>until</tt> loop works like a <tt>while</tt> loop,
except that it runs until the condition is true
(syntactical sugar really). 
Let's look at a BNF for these three loop types:</p>

<!-- BEGIN BNF Block -->
<pre>
LoopStatement ::= LoopClause StatementList
LoopClause    ::= <b>for (</b>Expression<b>;</b>Expression<b>;</b>Expression<b>) {</b> statementList <b>}</b>
| <b>foreach identifier (</b>Array<b>) {</b> statementList <b>}</b>
| <b>while (</b>Expression <b>) {</b> statementList <b>}</b>
| <b>until (</b>Expression<b>) {</b> statementList <b>}</b>
</pre>
<!-- END BNF Block -->

<p>
Our particular problem is an example of a <em>counting problem</em>,
in which we want to count from <em>start</em> to <em>stop</em>
by intervals of <em>increment</em>,
displaying the value of <em>count</em> and its logarithm.
For counting problems, the Perl <tt>for</tt>
loop provides the most convenient notation,
but you'll practice that in this week's project
so we'll use a while loop today.
</p>
In order to actually compute the logarithms, we'll use Perl's
<tt>log()</tt> function. However, Perl's log() function computes
the natural logarithm of the expression. To compute the log base
10 of a number we have to use basic algebra. To do this divide the
natural log of the number by the natural log of the desired base.
</p>
<p> 
We can use Perl's <tt>say</tt> statement to print a row of our table.  
But <tt>say</tt> will only display a single string.
We could write out each piece of the row with separate <tt>say</tt> 
(or <tt>print</tt>) statments, but Perl allows you to insert variable names 
directly within strings. In addition to the direct variable insertion Perl 
allows concatenations of expressions (such as an algebraic expression that
calculates a logarithm) to the end of a string simply by seperating the string 
and the expression by a comma (Perl also has a way to preform string interpolation 
by enclosing the function in curly braces and dereferencing the method like so 
${\ log($number)}, but this issomething of a hack with the string parser and is 
not recognized as an offical method). Write a single statement to print out a row. </p>
<p>
Then, all that's left to do is to increment our counting variable by
the increment variable the user provided.</p>
<p>
Be sure to test your program on a variety of input values.</p>
<p>
When you are certain it is correct, use <em>script</em> to 
list your program and show that it executes correctly.
<P>
That concludes the Perl part of this lab.
