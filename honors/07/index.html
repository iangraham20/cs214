Lab 7: Perl
</H2>
<HR>

<p>
Start by copying the file <em>NameTester.pl</em> from the course
directory into your directory for this lab.
Using your favorite text editor, open it up and take a few minutes
to look over its contents.
Then run it using the command:
<pre>
   perl NameTester.pl
</pre>
and verify that it runs correctly.
</p><p>
<b>The <tt>Name</tt> class</b>.
Uncomment the line:
<pre>
   #   name = Name.new("John", "Paul", "Jones")
</pre>
Then re-run your program.
What happens?
</p><p>
To fix the problem,
we need to define a Perl class named <tt>Name</tt>. 
Perl classes are simply namespaces called packages, 
for example a single file could have multiple namespaces 
declared as different package names.
Here is the basic BNF for a package declaration:</p> 
<!-- BEGIN BNF Block -->
<pre>
   PackageDec  ::= <b>package identifier;</b>
</pre>
<!-- END BNF Block -->

<h2>Building on the BNF</h2>
<p>The <strong>identifier</strong> for Perl classes must always
begin with a capital letter. 
This is because Perl has a semantic rule that constants must begin
with a capital letter. 
If you think about what a class is, it is a blueprint
-- a static structure that doesn't change --
and so this semantic rule makes a lot of sense. 
<p>
Using the BNF above, we might create this skeleton to work with:</p>

<!-- BEGIN Code Block -->
<pre>
   <b>package</b> Name;
</pre>
<!-- END Code Block -->
Add this to <em>NameTester.pl</em>.
Now, we just have to fill in the operations!

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p><b>Initialization</b>.
To initialize the members of a class in Perl,
we define a method named <tt>new()</tt>:
<!-- BEGIN Code Block -->
<pre>
   <b>
    sub new {
      my ($class, $myFirst, $myMiddle, $myLast) = @_;
      my $self = bless {myFirst => $myFirst, myMiddle => $myMiddle, myLast => $myLast}, $class;
      $self;
    }
  </b>
</pre>
<!-- END Code Block -->

The <tt>new()</tt> method serves as the class constructor.
It gets called when you send the class the 
<tt>new</tt> message, as in <tt>Name->new</tt>.
</p><p>
Looking at the definition of <tt>new()</tt> for 
<tt>Name</tt>, we can see an interesting bit of Perl syntax.
The technique here is called <em>blessing a package reference</em>,
and it allows us to access each of the global variables in the package 
only in association with that specific package. This allows you to apply 
special syntax to the blessed reference when we want to call subroutines 
from the package with one of the global variables as the first parameter 
(i.e. $object->printAllParameters(@otherArgs) would begin by printing 
$object assuming that it was blessed and in the same package as the subroutine
printAllParameters).
</p><p>
Add this to your <tt>Name</tt> class.
Then test what you have done so far.
If you've not made any mistakes, your program should now pass the test!
</p><p>

<b>Accessors</b>.
Uncomment the first <tt>assert</tt> line in the driver.
Re-run your program.
What happens? In Perl the global variables of an object can be accessed directly 
without having to write any getters of any kind. However, if we wanted to we could 
write a simple accessor like this:
<!-- BEGIN Code Block -->
<pre>
   <b>
    sub accessFirst {
      my ($self, $newValue) = @_;
      if (@_ == 2) {
        $self->{myFirst} = $newValue;
      }
      return $newValue;
    }
  </b>
</pre>
<!-- END Code Block -->
</p><p>
This would provide a single method that when called returns the value of myFirst, 
but also checks to see if the user passed a value into the method and sets myFirst 
to that new value. This is both a getter and setter method.
</p><p>
<b>The <tt>fullName</tt> Method</b>.
Uncomment the next-to-last assertion,
run your program, and verify that the assertion fails.
</p><p>
To pass the test,
we must define a <tt>fullName</tt> method that converts
a <tt>Name</tt> into a string.
To do so, we need a way to concatenate strings.
In Perl, we can use the <tt>.</tt> operator to perform string concatenation 
or the <tt>join</tt> method provided by perl. Here are some examples:
<pre>
  <b>
    my $input0 = "hello";
    my $input1 = "world!";
    my $output0 = join " ", $input0, $input1;
    my $output1 = $input0 . " " . $input1;

    print $output0;
    
    print $output1;

    $input0 .= $input1;
    print $input0;
  </b>
</pre>
<p>
All three of these examples would output <tt>hello world!</tt>. Try using the join method in your code.

</p><p>
Using this information, define method <tt>fullName</tt>.
Then re-run your program and verify that your method now passes the test.
Continue when it does.
</p><p>
<b>The <tt>print</tt> Method</b>.
Uncomment the final assertion in the program.
Re-run your program and verify that we fail the test.
</p><p>
To pass this test,
we need to write a method that prints the full name to the screen
and then returns that name to the caller.
Since we have defined the <tt>fullName</tt> method, this is simple.
The only "gotcha" is that you'll need to use <tt>say</tt>
instead of <tt>print</tt> to do the actual output, 
because calling <tt>print</tt> within a method called <tt>print</tt>
can cause a problem...
<p>
Note that the test expects this method to return the name
being printed, so be sure to make it do so.
(Remember, Perl methods return the last expression they evaluate.)
Aside from  that, the method should be easy to write.
<p>
When your are done, make sure that all of the test-code is uncommented
and test your class.
When everything works correctly, take a few minutes to document
each of your methods.
<p>
Then use <tt>script</tt> to make a recording named <em>script.Perl</em>
in which you list and then run <em>NameTester.pl</em>.
<P>
That concludes the Perl part of this lab.
