Lab 8: Perl
</H2>
<HR>
<p>
As a modern object-oriented language,
Perl supports the goals of modularity in multiple ways,
including its <b>package</b> mechanism and its 
<b>module</b> mechanism.
Today's exercise examines each of these.
<p>
Begin by making a <tt>Perl</tt> subdirectory within your
<tt>labs/08</tt> directory, and copying the file
<em>nameTester.pl</em> from the <tt>labs/08/Perl/</tt> directory 
into your subdirectory.
Open it up using your favorite text editor and take a few
moments to familiarize yourself with its contents,
customize its documentation, etc.
Then save and run it and verify that it works correctly.
<h3>Packages</h3>
<p>
So what does all of this mean for our <tt>Name</tt> package?  
Well, at the very least, we'd like this class to be reusable by
other programs. 
To accomplish this in Perl, there are a couple of different approaches:
<p>
<B>1. The <tt>require</tt> Approach</B>
If we put the <tt>Name</tt> class into a separate file called
<em>Name.pl</em>, we can then use the <tt>require</tt> method
to import this code into our current program. 
The <tt>require</tt> method is used to load another file and
execute all its statements, 
which will import all class and method definitions in the file.
In addition to simply executing all of the 
statements in the file, the <tt>require</tt> method also keeps
track of which files have been previously imported, and 
thus will not import the same file twice.
<p>
The require method takes the name of the file to require, as a
string, as a single argument. 
This can either be a path to the file, such as
<tt>./lib/some_library.pl</tt>  or a shortened name, 
such as <tt>some_library</tt>.
If the argument is a path and complete filename,
the <tt>require</tt> method will look there for the file.
However, if the argument is a shortened name, the <tt>require</tt>
method will search through a number of pre-defined directories
on your system for that file. 
Using the shortened name is the most common way of using the
<tt>require</tt> method.

<p>
Try using this approach for the <tt>Name</tt> class and driver program.
Put the class in its own file called <em>Name.pl</em>
and then import this file into the driver using the 
<tt>require</tt> method.
Note that you can enclose the name of the file to require in
either single quotes or double quotes. 
</p>

<p><B>2. The <tt>use</tt> Approach</B>
The <tt>use</tt> method works very similarly to the
<tt>require</tt> method, in that it causes all of the 
statements in the file to be executed. 
There are few differences though:  
<ul>
 <li>
  <tt>use</tt> requires the full name of the file to be used 
    (i.e. you must include the <em>.pl</em> extension of the file).
 <li>
  <tt>use</tt> does not keep track of whether or not the file has
  been previously loaded -- it <b>always</b> causes
  the statements in the file to be executed.
  This may seem a strange utility to provide, but consider the
  fact that Perl classes are continuously mutable. 
  By allowing a file to be reloaded, you can always bring in the
  most recent version of a file, even if some other process has
  been updating it in real-time.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Modules</h3>

In Perl,
modules are a way of grouping together methods, classes and constants.
One of the major benefits of a module is that it defines a namespace
and thus can help prevent name clashes.</p>

<p>
As you start to write bigger and bigger Perl programs, you'll
naturally find yourself producing chunks of reusable code -- 
libraries of related routines that are generally applicable.
You'll want to break this code out into separate files so the
contents can be shared among different Perl programs.</p>

<p>
Often this code will be organized into classes, so you'll
probably stick a package (or a set of interrelated classes) into a file.
This is the approach we will take for our <tt>Name</tt> package.
There are also times when you want to group things 
together that don't naturally form a package. 
An initial approach might be to put all these things into a file and 
simply load that file into any program that needs it.
This is the way the C language works.
However, there's a problem. 
Say you write a set of trigonometry functions sin, cos, and so on.
You stuff them all into a file, <em>trig.pl</em>, for 
future generations to enjoy. 
Meanwhile, Sally is working on a simulation of good and evil,
and codes up a set of her own useful routines, including
beGood and sin, and sticks them into <em>action.pl</em>.
Joe, who wants to write a program to find out how many angels
can dance on the head of a pin, needs to use both <em>trig.pl</em>
 and <em>action.pl</em> in his program.
But both define a method called <tt>sin</tt>.
Bad news.</p>

<p>This where where the module mechanism comes in.
Modules define a namespace, a walled-off sandbox in which your 
methods and constants can play without having to worry about
interfering with other methods and constants. 
The trig functions can go into one module: </p>
<PRE>
(Trig.pm)
  PI = 3.141592654
  sub Trig->sin(x)
   # ..
  }
  sub Trig->cos(x)
   # ..
  }
}
</PRE>
<p>and the good and bad action methods can go into another:</p>
<PRE>
(Actions.pm)
  VERY_BAD = 0
  BAD      = 1
  # ...
  sub Action->sin(badness)
    # ...
  }
}
</PRE>
<p>In perl a module is initialized by simply naming the file with the 
extention <tt>.pm</tt> (for perl module) instead of <tt>.pl</tt> and 
any code contained in that file is part of the module.</p>
<PRE>
require "trig"
require "action"

y = Trig->sin(Trig->{PI}/4)
wrongdoing = Action->sin(Action->{VERY_BAD})
</PRE>
<p>In Perl you only need to use or require the module name to be 
  able to access the package methods contained in the module, which 
  can be done by simply calling the method without preceding it with 
  the module name or any other syntax.
</p>

<p>
Refactor (or rename) your code to wrap the <tt>Name</tt> package in a module
named <tt>Names.pm</tt>, and then use it within your driver.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Testing</b>.
Test your changes and continue when your program works correctly.

<p>
<b>Turn In</b>:
Use <tt>script</tt> to create a file in which you
list each of your Perl source files,
and then run your test program.
</p>
<P>
That concludes the Perl part of this lab.
