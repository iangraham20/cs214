</H2>
<HR>
<p>
Perl does provide a <tt>List</tt> data structure of sorts,
but it is essentially the array data structure with support 
for a few extra operations (for example a perl array supports 
push, pop, shift, and unshift, which all add or remove items 
to the beginning or end of the array). so we will need to build 
our own <tt>Linked List</tt> to complete this lab exercise.
<P>
Begin by making a <TT>Perl</TT> subdirectory in your <TT>labs/09</TT>
directory.
Then copy the files <em>list_tester.pl</em> and <em>MyList.pm</em>
from the course <TT>labs/09/Perl</TT> directory into your new directory.
Use your favorite text editor to open these files,
and take a moment to study their contents.
<p>
The file <em>MyList.pm</em> contains a skeleton for package <TT>MyList</TT>.
Look over its contents carefully, to get a sense for what has been
done, and what remains to be done...
<P>
<B>Building A Perl List Type</B>.
Since a list consists of linked nodes, we might begin by creating a 
<TT>Node</TT> type that stores an integer 
and a pointer to a <TT>Node</TT>:
<PRE>
   <b>package MyNode;</B>
</PRE>
Find the appropriate comment within the <tt>MyList</tt> package
and replace it with this declaration.

<b>Node Instance Variables</b>.
As we have seen before, Perl does not require us to declare
instance variables; we need only name them in methods.
Since our <tt>MyNode</tt> package needs two instance variables
-- one to store the value and one to store the link to the next node --
we might proceed by defining constructor for our <tt>MyNode</tt> package:
<pre>
   package myNode;

<b>sub new {
    my ($class, $item, $link) = @_;
    my $self = bless {myValue => $item, myNext => $link}, $class;
    $self;
  }</b>
</pre>
And that's it. Perl does not provide any way of keeping instance variables 
private so we do not need to make and getter or setter methods (we could if 
we wanted to use an informal method of keeping the variables private).

This gives us a <tt>MyNode</tt> package that we can use
in our <tt>MyList</tt> methods, and if necessary, we can always return
later and modify it.
<p>
<b>List Instance Variables</b>.
Switch for a moment to <em>list_tester.pl</em> and note that
the program does these things:
<ol>
 <li>
   it requires our <tt>MyList</tt> package,
 <li>
   it constructs empty <TT>MyList</TT> objects,
 <li>
  it appends values to them,
 <li>
  it  prints them, and 
 <li>
  it finds their maximum values.
</ol>
These provide us with a road map for what we need to do in the
remainder of this exercise.
<p>
Our next task is thus to define a <tt>MyList</tt> constructor.
Again referring to the <tt>append()</tt> method, we see that
our <TT>MyList</TT> has three instance variables for the constructor
to initialize:
<UL>
 <LI>
   <TT>myFirst</TT>, a reference to the first node in the list, and
  <LI>
    <TT>myLast</TT>, a reference to the last node in the list;
  <li>
   <TT>myLength</TT>, an integer storing the number of values in the list.
</UL>
In Perl, <tt>undef</tt> is the equivalent of null pointer in C++.
<p>
Using this information, add a <TT>new</TT> method
to the <tt>MyList</tt> package that initializes
<tt>myFirst</tt> and <tt>myLast</tt> to <tt>undef</tt>
and <tt>myLength</tt> to zero.
<p>

<P>
<B>Defining a Print Method</B>.
To display the values in a <TT>MyList</TT>, we will write a method
that traverses the list, displaying each of its values in turn.
In <em>MyList.pm</em>, scan through its contents
until you reach the documentation for the <TT>print</TT> method.
There, we can create a stub method named <TT>print</TT>,
that satisfies the specification given back in 
<A HREF="..">the introduction</A>:
<PRE>
   package MyList; 
      ...
    <b>sub print {
      }</b>
      ...
</PRE>
To fill in this stub, we can use the following algorithm to 
traverse the <tt>List</tt>:
<PRE>
   1. Define a local variable named <em>$temp</em>
      and initialize it to refer to the first node.
   2. While <EM>$temp</EM> is not undef:
       a. Display the value of <EM>$temp</EM>'s node.
       b. Advance <EM>$temp</EM> to the next node (if any).
</PRE>
Perl does not have pointer variables as a distinct type like C++.
Instead, it is more like Java, in that variables that refer to
objects (i.e., instances of classes) are <em>reference</em> 
or pointer variables under the hood.
Unlike Java, Perl has no primitive types, so all Perl types are classes,
which means that all Perl variables are really pointers.
So Perl does not require us to do anything unusual to define,
initialize, assign or compare pointer variables/values
other than what we have seen previously.
Using this information, we can declare <TT>$temp</TT>,
and initialize it to the address of our first node,
which is stored in <tt>myFirst</tt>:
<PRE>
   package MyList;
      ...
      sub printList {
     <b>my $self = shift;
        my $temp = $self->{myFirst};</b>
      }
      ...
</PRE>
<P>
To perform step 2 of our algorithm, we can use Perl's pretest loop.
For its condition, we can use the <tt>nil?</tt> method --
a message that can be sent to any Perl object -- which returns true
if the object's value is <tt>nil</tt> and returns false otherwise.
We can thus construct a loop to traverse our <TT>List</TT>
as follows:
<PRE>
   package MyList;
      ...
      sub printList {
        my $self = shift;
        my $temp = $self->{myFirst};
     <b>while ($temp != undef) {
        }
     </b>
      }
      ...
</PRE>
Within this loop, we can add statements to display the
<TT>value</TT> member of the node pointed to 
by <TT>$temp</TT>, and to change the value of <TT>$temp</TT>
to the value of the <TT>next</TT> member of the node
to which <TT>$temp</TT> points.
Since using <tt>print</tt> to display a <tt>Node</tt>'s value
could be a recursive call and produce a runaway recursion,
we have named our print function <tt>printList</tt> instead of 
<tt>print<tt> so that we can use perl's print function:
<PRE>
   package List; 
      ...
        sub printList {
          my $self = shift;
          my $temp = $self->{myFirst};
          while ($temp != undef) {
            print(" ", $temp->{myValue});
            $temp = $temp->{myNext};
          }
        }
      ...
<p>
If we have not made any mistakes, our method to display
the values in a <tt>MyList</tt> should now be complete,
and you should be able to run the program in <em>list_tester.pl</em>
to test what you have done thus far.
<p>
<B>Finding the Maximum Value in a List</B>.
 If necessary take a moment to review the
 <A HREF="..">specification</A> for this operation.
 To find the maximum value in a list, we can use this algorithm:
   1. Initialize a variable named <EM>$temp</EM> to the address of our first node.
   2. Initialize <EM>$maxValue</EM> to a very negative integer (e.g., -999999).
   3. While <EM>$temp</EM> is not undef:
       a. If the value of <EM>$temp</em>'s node is greater than <EM>$maxValue</EM>,
             Change <EM>$maxValue</EM> to the value of <EM>$temp</em>'s node.
       b. Advance <EM>$temp</EM> to the next node (if any).
   4. Return <EM>$maxValue</EM>.
Using everything you have learned thus far, find the documentation
for the <tt>listMax</tt> method within package <tt>MyList</tt>.
There, define a Perl method that implements this algorithm.
<P>
<B>Testing</B>.
To test the correctness of your work,
uncomment the lines in <em>list_tester.pl</em> that invoke the
<tt>listMax</tt> method.
Save your changes, run <em>list_tester.pl</em>, and continue
when everything works correctly.
<P>
<b>Turn In</b>.
When all is correct,
create a script file in which you
(i) run your program to show that it works correctly, and
(ii) use <TT>cat</TT> to display the contents of both your  
<tt>.pl</tt> and your <tt>.pm</tt> files.
<P>
That concludes the Perl part of this lab.
