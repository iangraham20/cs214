 <A HREF="../../..">CS 214</A> Lab 10: Inheritance and Polymorphism in Perl
</H2>
<p>
We will be creating several files in this exercise, so
to keep things organized, begin by creating a subdirectory named
<tt>Perl</tt> within your <tt>lab10</tt> directory
and <tt>cd</tt> to that subdirectory.

<h3>A Class for the Birds</h3>
<p>Let's begin looking at inheritence in Perl 
by building a superclass called <tt>Bird</tt>
from which our <tt>Duck</tt>, <tt>Goose</tt>,
and <tt>Owl</tt> classes will derive their functionality.</p>
<p>
To start, use your favorite text editor to open a file named
<em>Bird.pm</em> and copy the following class skeleton into it:</p>

<!-- BEGIN Code Block -->
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
# Bird.pm defines a Bird superclass to be extended by specific bird sub-classes
# Begun by: Ian Christensen, for CS 214 at Calvin College
# Completed by: 
# Date: 

package Bird;
use feature qw(say);

# Subroutine: new, constructor for Bird
# Preconditions: Bird module was required
# Receives: $class, the class object; $name, a string
# Returns: $self, a Bird object
sub new {
  my ($class, $name) = @_;
  my $self = bless {myName => $name}, $class;
  $self;
}

# Subroutine: call, 
# Precondition: Bird object must exist
# Receives: a Bird object
# Returns: 'Squaaaaaaawk!', the generic bird call

# replace this line with the call subroutine

# Subroutine: className, accessor for the class name
# Precondition: Bird must exist
# Receives: $self, a Bird object
# Returns: , the Bird object's class

# replace this line with the className subroutine

# Subroutine: print, output operation for Bird object
# Precondition: Bird must exist
# Receives: a Bird object
# Postcondition: outputs the Bird object's name, classname, and call

# replace this line with the print subroutine

1;

</pre>
<!-- END Code Block -->

<p>As you can see, the constructor (the <tt>new</tt> subroutine)
for the <tt>name</tt> instance variable has already been set up for you. 
You'll need to add the <tt>call</tt> and <tt>print</tt> subroutines
to finish the definition (but not the <tt>class_name</tt> subroutine
as we'll soon see).</p>

<h3>The <tt>call</tt>, <tt>className</tt>, and <tt>print</tt> subroutines</h3>
<p>
Since every bird needs to say something, we need to provide our
<tt>Bird</tt> superclass with a definition of a general <tt>call</tt>
subroutine.
It should return the string <tt>'Squaaaaaaawk!'</tt>,
which is the sound every unknown bird makes.</p>
<p>
In addition, we need to be able to print a message containing everything
we need to know about our bird.
It should output a string containing the bird's name,
the specific class name (we'll get to this shortly),
the string " says ", and the return value of the <tt>
call</tt> subroutine. As in previous exercises, you can 
use <tt>puts</tt> to output this string to the screen, 
and the <tt>+</tt> symbol to concatenate two strings.</p>
<p>
Now you may be asking where we get the specific class name from in Perl?
In other languages such a feat would be difficult and so we might
instead simply hard code in the name as a string.
In Perl however, we can access the class name with the expression:
<pre>
   ref($self);
</pre>
This attribute comes in handy for more advanced inheritance features
of Perl, but for now it'll serve us well to tell us what kind of
bird we're dealing with.</p>
<p>
Putting all of this together gives us these function definitions:
<pre>
package Bird;
use feature qw(say);

sub new {
  my ($class, $name) = @_;
  my $self = bless {myName => $name}, $class;
  $self;
}

sub call {
  'Squaaaaaaawk!';
}

sub className {
  my $self = shift;
  ref($self);
}

sub print {
  my $self = shift;
  say $self->{myName}, $self->className, " says ", $self->call;
}

1;
</pre>


<h3>The Rest of the Flock</h3>
<p>Now that we've declared our <tt>Bird</tt> superclass,
we need to declare our <tt>Duck</tt>, <tt>Goose</tt>,
and <tt>Owl</tt> subclasses.
Open a new file <em>Owl.pl</em> and add the following
class skeleton to it: </p>

<!-- BEGIN Code Block -->
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
# Owl.pm defines the Owl class which inherits attributes and methods from the Bird superclass
# Begun by: Ian Christensen, for CS 214 at Calvin College
# Completed by:
# Date:

package Owl;
use parent Bird;

# Subroutine: call, accessor for a Owl call
# Precondition: Owl must exist
# Receives: a Owl object
# Returns: 'Whoo-hoo!', a Owl call

# replace this line with the call subroutine

1;

</pre>
<!-- END Code Block -->

<p>
As you might have guessed the <tt>use parent</tt> header
is what triggers inheritance in Perl.
We use it here to make <tt>Owl</tt> a subclass of <tt>Bird</tt>.
(This kind of inheritence is single inheritance.)
<p>
Once you've copied the class into <em>Owl.pm</em>,
you'll need to write a class-specific <tt>call</tt> subroutine.
It shouldn't be too difficult &mdash; use the subroutine from
<tt>Bird</tt> as a model and change the string
from <tt>'Squaaaaaaawk!'</tt> to <tt>'Whoo-hoo!'</tt>.
Once you've done that, you're done!
Since we didn't need to hard-code in the class name,
there's no need to override the <tt>className</tt> subroutine
that <tt>Owl</tt> inherits from <tt>Bird</tt>.
And since we didn't add any attributes to our class,
there's no need to define a new constructor.</p>
<p>
Now just repeat this process to define <tt>Duck</tt> 
and <tt>Goose</tt> classes.
Once you've done that, all that's left is test our code.

<h3>Testing</h3>
Use your editor to open a file named <em>Birds.pl</em>
and copy the following driver into it:

<!-- BEGIN Code Block -->
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# Birds.pl tests out the menagerie of bird classes
# Begun by: Ian Christensen, for CS 214 at Calvin College
# Completed by:
# Date:

use strict;
use feature qw(say);

require Bird;
require Duck;
require Goose;
require Owl;

if (__FILE__ eq $0) {
  say "\nWelcome to the Bird Park!\n";

  my $bird0 = Bird->new("Hawkeye");
  $bird0->print;

  my $bird1 = Duck->new("Donald");
  $bird1->print;

  my $bird2 = Goose->new("Mother");
  $bird2->print;

  my $bird3 = Owl->new("Woodsey");
  $bird3->print;

  say "\n";
}

</pre>
<!-- END Code Block -->

Save, and test your creation by entering the following
command on the command-line:
<pre>
   perl Birds.pl
</pre>
If all is well, each of your flock should do their own things.
If not, find and fix the errors before proceeding.
<p>
As we have defined it, each bird's name and class-name are
jammed together.
Find and improve this by making a space appear between each bird's name
and class-name.
Note that thanks to inheritance and polymorphism,
you only have to make this change in one place,
and all of our birds inherit that change.

<p>
<b>Turn In</b>.
When all is correct,
create a script file in which you
(i) run your program to show that it works correctly, and
(ii) use <TT>cat</TT> to display the contents of each of your 
<tt>.pl</tt> and <tt>.pm</tt> files.
<P>
That concludes the Perl part of this lab.
<P>
If this was your last exercise, return to the
<a href="../">lab 10</a> page and follow the 
"Turn In" instructions there.
