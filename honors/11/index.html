  Lab 11: Multithreading in Perl 
</H2>
<HR>
<P>
Since we will be dealing with multiple files,
begin by creating a new subdirectory named <TT>Perl</TT>
within your directory for this lab.
Then copy the file 
<a href="array_sum.pl"><em>array_sum.pl</em></a> 
into your new directory.
Use your favorite text editor to open this file,
customize its opening documentation, and take a moment to study 
what it is doing and how it is doing it.
<p>
Since we have the sum of the values in each input file
recorded in our spreadsheet, let's begin by running
the program to make sure that it produces correct results.
<p>
In your spreadsheet, add a column labeled <em>Perl</em>.
Using the <tt>perl</tt> command,
verify that <em>array_sum.pl</em> produces the correct sum
for each file in:
<pre>
   /home/cs/214/labs/11/numbers/
</pre>
If it does, run the program three times for each file,
and record the middle of the three execution times in your spreadsheet
in the appropriate cells of your <em>Perl</em> column.
These values, computed with a single thread,
will provide us with a baseline against which
we can compare the speedup provided by multithreading.
<p>
<b>Preliminaries</b>.
Before we delve into multithreading in Perl,
let's first look at some of the details of how <em>array_sum.pl</em>
is doing what it does.
<p>
<b>Command-Line Arguments in Perl</b>.
Perl programs have a built-in array constant named <tt>ARGV</tt>,
that provides access to any command-line arguments.
In particular:
<ul>
 <li>
  <tt>scalar @ARGV</tt> provides the number of
   arguments specified on the command-line.
   Note that unlike C/C++, Perl does not count the name of the program
   as one of the arguments.
 <li>
  <tt>$ARGV[<em>$i</em>]</tt> can be used to retrieve
   a <tt>String</tt> containing the command-line 
   argument whose index is <tt><em>$i</em></tt>.
   Perl's array indices begin with 0.
</ul>
Find where each of these are used in <em>array_sum.pl</em> and make certain
you understand how they are being used before proceeding.
<p>
<b>Reading the Numbers</b>.
Perl provides dynamic arrays, which our <tt>readFile</tt> function uses
to store the values it reads from the input file.
Our approach is a bit unusual though: 
instead of reading the file line by line into an integer array,
we first use Perl's <tt>open(LINES, "<", $arg)</tt> method to open the file, 
and then <tt>my @strArray = <LINES>;<tt> to read all of the lines from the file 
into a variable named <tt>@strArray</tt>.
Then, since the first line of the input file contains the number
of values to be processed, the first item in <tt>strArray</tt>
is the number of integers we need to store,
so we use that information to allocate an array named <tt>intArray</tt>
that is the correct size.
Once we have our <tt>intArray</tt> allocated, we use a foreach loop to convert
the remaining strings in <tt>strArray</tt> into integers,
which we store in <tt>intArray</tt>.
The function then lists <tt>intArray</tt> as its final value,
making it the <tt>readFile</tt> function's return value.
<p>
<b>Timing the Operation</b>
<p>
To determine the execution time of function <tt>sum()</tt>,
we can use Perl's <tt>Time::HiRes</tt> class, which 
(among other things) provides:
<ul>
 <li>
  A <tt>Time</tt> type representing the current date and time.
 <li>
  The <tt>gettimeofday</tt> method, which returns the current time.
  We use it to declare variables in which 
  to store the times before and after we call <tt>sum()</tt>.
 <li>
  The <tt>-</tt> operator, which lets us compute the difference of
   two <tt>Time</tt> values.
 <li>
  The <tt>to_f</tt> method that, sent to a <tt>Time</tt> object,
   converts it to a floating point (real) number.
 </ul> 
Find each of these features in the program and make sure that you
understand how and why they are being used before continuing.
<p>
<P>
<B>Multithreading in Perl</B>.
Perl provides a <tt>Thread</tt> class, to which we can pass
a block containing the instructions we want that thread to perform.
<p>
Begin by making a copy of <em>array_sum.pl</em> and name the copy
<em>threaded_array_sum.pl</em>.
Then open <em>threaded_array_sum.pl</em> and customize its
opening documentation, the name of the program, etc.
<p>
Since the existing <tt>sum()</tt> function
sums the entire array, let's begin by modifying it
for multithreading
to sum a slice of the array, based on its thread's ID
and the size of its slice.
For the sake of readability, let's rename it <tt>sumSlice()</tt>
and modify it so that it follows
the algorithm we gave in this exercise's introduction:
<pre>
   ...
   sub <font color="#FF0000"><b>sumSlice</b></font> {
   <font color="#FF0000"><b>my ($id, $sliceSize</b></font>, @values) = @_;
      <font color="#FF0000"><b>my $start = $id * $sliceSize;
      my $stop = $start + $sliceSize - 1</b></font>
      <font color="#FF0000"><b>myTotal</b></font> = 0;
      foreach my $i <font color="#FF0000"><b>($start..$stop) {</b></font>
         <font color="#FF0000"><b>$myTotal</b></font> += $values[$i];
      }
      <font color="#FF0000"><b>myTotal</b></font>
   }
   ...
</pre>
Our revised method receives the thread ID
and the size of the array-slice it is to sum via its parameters.
It uses them to compute its starting and stopping index values,
and then uses those values to drive a for loop that
accumulates its partial sum
in a local variable <tt>$myTotal</tt>, which it returns.
<p>
Now that we have a function to sum a slice of our array,
we are ready to proceed with the other revisions
to the sequential program.
<p>
Let's begin by modifying the body of procedure <tt>checkCommandLine</tt>,
as shown in bold below:
<pre>
  sub checkCommandLine {
    if (scalar @ARGV != <font color="#FF0000"><b>2</b></font>) {
      say "\nUsage: sum <inFileName> <numThreads>\n\n";
      exit(1);
    }
  }

</pre> 
Function <tt>readFile()</tt> remains unchanged.
<p>
However, in our <tt>main</tt> function,
we need to replace the call to <tt>sum()</tt> with code that will 
sum the array using multiple threads.
Since this sounds complicated, let's do it in a new method we will call
<tt>sumInParallel()</tt>:
<pre>
  <font color="#FF0000"><b>sub sumInParallel(values, numThreads)
      my ($numThreads, @values) = @_;
      my $sliceSize = int(scalar @values / $numThreads);
      my @threadArray;
      $threadArray[$numThreads] = undef;
      my $result :shared = 0;
      my $mutex :shared;
<!---
      for i in 1..numThreads-1
-->
      foreach my $i (1..$numThreads-1) {
        $threadArray[$i] = threads->create(
          sub { 
            my $myTotal = sumSlice($i, $sliceSize, @values);
            { lock($mutex); $result += $myTotal; }
          }
        );
      }

      my $myTotal = sumSlice(0, $sliceSize, @values);

      my $leftovers = scalar @values % $numThreads;
      if ($leftovers > 0) {
        foreach my $i (scalar @values - $leftovers..scalar @values - 1) {
          $myTotal += $values[$i];
        }
      }

      { lock($mutex); $result += $myTotal; }

      foreach my $i (1..$numThreads-1) {
        $threadArray[$i]->join();
      }
      $result;
}</b></font>
</pre>
This function receives from its caller the array of values to be summed, 
plus the number of threads to be used to sum the array.
We start by computing the size of our slice,
using the approach from our introduction:
<pre>
   my $sliceSize = int(scalar @values / $numThreads);
</pre>
Since the user is passing the desired number of threads to our program
via a command-line argument,
we cannot know many threads are needed.
We use the standard workaround:
build a <em>dynamic array of threads</em>:
<pre>
   ...
   my @threadArray;
   $threadArray[$numThreads] = undef;
   ...
</pre>
Then, we define our <tt>$result</tt> variable that we will use
to communicate our grand total back to the caller:
<pre>
   my $result :shared = 0
</pre>
<p>
We need some way of letting each thread communicate its partial result 
back to our original thread.
Perl does not have a <tt>reduction</tt> operation like OpenMP,
nor does it have synchronized entry procedures like Ada.
One approach might be to have
each thread add the values in its slice to <tt>$result</tt>
one at a time:
<pre>
   $result += $values[$i];     # DON'T do this
</pre>
This is a bad idea, because
we would get lots of write-write conflicts,
since the threads will all be trying to write to our shared 
<tt>result</tt> variable at the same time.
Moroever, this approach would require a write to the shared variable
for each entry in the array -- 
if our array is length <em>N</em>,
it would require <em>O(N)</em> writes to the shared variable,
and synchronizing all of those writes would greatly slow
our function.
<p>
Instead, we will have each thread accumulate its partial sum
in a local variable called <tt>$myTotal</tt>.
When it is finished computing the partial sum,
we have each thread add that partial sum
to <tt>$result</tt>:
<pre>
   $result += $myTotal     # OK, if synchronized
</pre>
This approach requires just one write to the shared variable per thread,
so for <em>T</em> threads, we will need just <em>O(T)</em>
synchronizations.
To facilitate those synchronizations, we declare a <tt>lock</tt>
object named <tt>$mutex</tt>:
<pre>
   my $mutex :shared;
</pre>
</p><p>
We might visualize this approach as follows:
<p>
<center>
<img src="../images/7.Perl-exclusive.png"
     width="672" height="400"
     alt="Using a shared variable">
</center>
<p>
Once we have an array of threads, a shared <tt>result</tt> variable,
a <tt>Mutex</tt> to synchronize the accesses to it,
and the size of the array-slice a thread is to sum,
we use an <tt>foreach</tt> loop to launch the threads:
<pre>
   ...
    foreach my $i (1..$numThreads-1) {
      $threadArray[$i] = threads->create(
        sub { 
          my $myTotal = sumSlice($i, $sliceSize, @values);
          { lock($mutex); $result += $myTotal; }
        }
      );
    }
   ...
</pre>
If the user specifies that <em>T</em> threads are to be used,
this loop will launch <em>T</em>-1 new threads,
each using method <tt>sumSlice()</tt> to add up the values in its
slice of the <tt>@values</tt> array,
and then storing that partial sum in <tt>$myTotal</tt>.
Once it has accomplished that, it must add the partial sum in
<tt>$myTotal</tt> to the shared <tt>$result</tt> variable.
To prevent write-write conflicts, these writes to <tt>$result</tt>
must be synchronized.
Perl provides a variety of ways to do this;
here we use the <b><tt>lock()</tt> block</b>
(shown above), which uses our <tt>lock</tt> object named <tt>$mutex</tt>
to ensure that only one thread
at a time will perform the statement(s) within its block.
By wrapping each thread's write to the shared variable <tt>$result</tt>
in a <tt>synchronize</tt> block, we synchronize the accesses to it,
and thus prevent write-write conflicts from occurring.
<p>
Note that we give the first thread ID 1, because the
(original) thread that is launching these threads
will receive ID 0.
<p>
With that done, our threads are now off and running, each
summing its own slice of the array.
<p>
Our original thread can then sum up the values in its slice,
using ID 0, and storing its partial sum in its own local variable 
<tt>myTotal</tt>:
<pre>
   ...
   my $myTotal = sumSlice(0, $sliceSize, @values);
   ...
</pre>
With its slice summed, it then adds
any left-overs to the partial sum in its <tt>$myTotal</tt> variable:
<pre>
      ...
      my $leftovers = scalar @values % $numThreads;
      if ($leftovers > 0) {
        foreach my $i (scalar @values - $leftovers..scalar @values - 1) {
          $myTotal += $values[$i];
        }
      }
      ...
</pre>
Since the number of left-over values will be less than
the number of tasks, this will not take very long,
provided the array is much larger than
the number of threads we are using.
<p>
With the sum of thread 0's slice plus the left-overs accumulated in 
its <tt>$myTotal</tt> variable, 
our original thread just has to add this value to the shared
<tt>$result</tt> variable.
Since another thread could also be adding its partial sum to
<tt>$result</tt>, this write must be synchronized:
<pre>
  { lock($mutex); $result += $myTotal; }
</pre>
However, in Perl, if our original thread should happen to finish
before the helper threads, all of those threads will terminate,
without having finished their tasks.
To prevent this, 
the original thread must make certain that the helper threads
have finished summing their array-slices before it returns
the value in <tt>$result</tt>.
We accomplish this using the <tt>join()</tt> method:
<pre>
   ...
      foreach my $i (1..$numThreads-1) {
        $threadArray[$i]->join();
      }
      $result;
    }
</pre>
A message <tt><em>t</em>->join()</tt> causes the thread
that <b>sends</b> that message (i.e., our original thread)
to suspend until thread <tt><em>t</em></tt> terminates. 
(If the thread has already terminated, our original thread
keeps going to the next repetition of the loop.)
Once thread <em>t</em> terminates, our original thread 
resumes execution where it left off.
The <tt>join()</tt> method is thus a simple way
to synchronize two threads.
<p>
By using a for loop to iterate through our thread array, 
sending each thread therein the <tt>join()</tt> message,
we ensure that all threads have terminated before we return
<tt>result</tt>.
<p>
Note that for <em>T</em> threads and an array of length <em>N</em>, 
the cost of this parallel sum operation is <em>O(N/T + T)</em>,
where <em>O(N/T)</em> is the cost of computing the partial sums,
and <em>O(T)</em> is the cost of adding up those partial sums.
By contrast, the cost of our parallel sum in C++ using OpenMP's
<tt>reduction</tt> mechanism was <em>O(N/T +
log<sub>2</sub>(T))</em>,
since the <tt>reduction</tt> can be done in time
<em>log<sub>2</sub>(T)</em>.
So long as <em>T</em> is small and <em>N</em> is large,
the size of the array will be the dominant factor and
the two approaches should perform similarly.
However, if we are on a computer with many cores and increase
<em>T</em> significantly, the logarithmic <tt>reduction</tt>
approach will scale better than linear approach we used here.
<p>
All that is left is a minor modification to the body
of our <tt>main</tt> function:
<pre>
  sub main {
    checkCommandLine;
    my @values = readFile;
    my $startTime = [gettimeofday];
    my $total = <font color="#FF0000"><b>sumInParallel($ARGV[1], @values);</b></font>
    my $endTime = [gettimeofday];
    my $interval = tv_interval($startTime, $endTime);
    say "\nThe sum is $total\n";
    printf(" and computing it took %.9f seconds.\n\n", $interval);
  }
</pre>
Note that we must convert the command-line argument (a string)
to an integer before we can pass it to our <tt>sumInParallel()</tt>
function's integer parameter.
We use Perl's <tt>int()</tt> class constructor to perform this
conversion.
<p>
<b>Testing</b>.
Save your changes and use <tt>Perl</tt> to 
run <em>threaded_array_sum</em> on the input files from the
course directory.
Begin with the largest input file and 4 threads:
<pre>
   threaded_array_sum /home/cs/214/adams/labs/11/numbers/1000000numbers.txt 4
</pre>
Do you get the correct result? 
If not, debug your program and continue when you do.
<p>
<b>Performance Analysis</b>.
To see what kind of speedup we are getting,
add 5 more columns to your spreadsheet, and label them
<tt>1 2 3 4 5</tt>.
For each of the input files, 
run it three times using 1 thread,
and record the median (middle) time in the appropriate row 
of your spreadsheet under column 1.
How does the time for <em>threaded_array_sum.pl</em> using 1 
thread compare to the time for <em>array_sum.pl</em>?
<p>
Repeat this procedure using 2, 3, 4, and 5 threads and 
record the middle times in the appropriate spreadsheet cells.
In your spreadsheet, answer the following questions:
<p>
<font color="#FF0000">
Perl.1. How does the time using <em>threaded_array_sum.pl</em> and 1
thread compare to the time using <em>array_sum.pl</em>?
<p>
Perl.2. How do the times using T > 1 threads
compare to the times using a single thread?
Explain what is happening.
<p>
Perl.3. How do your Perl times compare to your Java times?
<p>
Perl.4. How is multithreading in Perl different from our other languages?
</font>
<p>
In your spreadsheet,
create a three dimensional bar chart that shows
the performance of <em>threaded_array_sum.pl</em>
using 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 threads,
for the array sizes 1000, 10000, 100000, and 1000000.
Be sure to give your chart a descriptive title,
and label all axes appropriately.
<p>
<b>Turn In</b>:
Create a script file in which you use <tt>cat</tt>
to display <em>threaded_array_sum.pl</em>.
Then 
run <em>threaded_array_sum.pl</em>,
using the file <em>1000000numbers.txt</em> and 1 thread;
then run <em>threaded_array_sum.pl</em>,
using the same input file and 4 threads.
Quit script and print a hard copy of this script file, 
plus your spreadsheet and its chart.
<P>
That concludes the Perl portion of this lab.
